🌿 Moodscaping

Moodscaping is a simple and elegant web app that generates inspirational moods — pairs of quotes and images — based on a user’s chosen keyword or at random. It combines the power of text and imagery to evoke emotion, reflection, or inspiration with a single click.

✨ Features
	•	Enter a word or press “Random” to generate a mood
	•	Displays a matching quote and image
	•	Dynamically fetches data from:
	•	[Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable?tab=readme-ov-file#get-random-quote)￼ for quotes
	•	Unsplash￼ for images
	•	Smooth transitions for an immersive, aesthetic experience

🧠 Tech Stack
	•	HTML5 for structure
	•	CSS3 for layout and visual design
	•	Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) for logic, API calls, and DOM manipulation

⸻

🚀 How It Works
	1.	User types a keyword (e.g. “hope”, “mountain”, “calm”) or clicks “Random”.
	2.	App fetches a relevant image from Unsplash using the keyword.
	3.	App displays a random or keyword-related quote.
	4.	Background and text smoothly transition to the new “moodscape”.
