Initial notes
Prologue: create README.md file for outlining the concept
Then,

HTML file
1. Create the html, js and css files
2. design a minimalistic html file with two canvases: one for the image, and another for the text. body with soft background.
3. load the js script that executes API calls

JS file:
Initialize API calls for both the Quote generator and Unsplash
test and log api results to ensure they work
use DOM manipulation to hook the script to the relevant containers and displaying them
create eventlisteners so buttons are functional and do what they're designed to do, including forms for text input

Once that's done, we'll create a logic so that whatever the user inputs is scanned and picksup on keywords that then get sent over the APIs (both the quote gen and unsplash)
then display quote and image (together, or with setInterval)

Optional: add a way to save quote and image if desired localstorage

Define user flow:
“User enters a keyword → press button → app fetches data → display moodscape → allow saving.”
